            <p class="text">
              Meeting you changed my life in a colorful way. You broke my silly
              belief about Online love and transformed how I see it. Before, I
              thought love was just about being with someone, but when I met
              you, I realized what it means to have commitments. You've brought
              joy and purpose into my dull life. Every moment with you will
              always be a treasured memory, and you've shown me the true meaning
              of being with someone you love and I am so grateful for you.<br />Recently,
              I was really mentally exhausted and broken, unable to put in that
              simple trust and belief you wanted (I know it wasn't anything out
              of the blue). But now, feeling this emptiness, I can't help but
              look at your pictures and pray for you to become an even better
              person. So wishing you a very Happy Birthday to you Baby.

            <h2>Our First Date</h2>
            <p class="text">
              Our first Movie date on 30.10.2023 was unforgettable. We went to
              see the 12th Fail movie, and it was such a fun & motivating
              experience. It was my first Hindi movie in cinemas, and you made
              it even more special. I remember the excitement and joy of
              watching it with you(and ahem). We laughed about random stuffs
              during the interval, which somehow added to the fun of the day.
              It's a memory I will always cherish.
              <br />
              I remember looking at your smile and your nagging to take my mask
              off while feeling how lucky i was to have gotten a chance to be
              the love of your life in this boring life of mine. I remember how
              the first thing I did was hug you out of happiness behind the
              cricket court and how we were so sad with that goodbye. So,
              remembering all these moments, I wish you a very happy birthday,
              my Big Babla ji.

            <h2>We Didn't just Vibe</h2>
            <p class="text">
              We used to spend hours on Calls, and every day that passed without
              double tick showing not showing now on Whatsapp made me so sad and
              regretful. I miss mera jealous hona Aadya se fir ghanto baatein
              karna PJ ke padhte time. Those moments are unforgettable, and they
              make me realize how special our time together on call was.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              We didn't just vibe; we stayed with each other, giving company
              even when things got boring. It wasn't the fun we had on call but
              the sense of home we felt with each other's company and voice. So,
              a BIG THANKS for everything you have done for me. All I would like
              is to talk or give it a start maybe.

            <p class="text">
              From our first date to the last and all the time we spent talking
              with each other still feels like a bliss to me and I know for a
              fact you feel the same except got the regret that I made things
              end a way they werent supposed to. Just because something has to
              end doesn't mean that it has to end badly. From your scent to your
              smile and from holding hands to kissing you, everything still
              feels as real to me as we did on the first time except now its all
              in my imagination.
              <br />
              I said I regret choosing you over a fight and I realised that one
              line like that is enough to shake someone up from the very bottom
              when you get to hear "I regret saying yes to you". All the mean
              things I said shouldnt damp down your birthday so I wont text a
              single time on your birth day. Enjoy your day and don't forget to
              remember me atleast once. Please.<br>HAPPY BIRTHDAY BABY JI.
